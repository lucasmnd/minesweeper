# 1. Definition of the Minesweeper Structure

In this section, we establish the mathematical framework used to model the Minesweeper board, the mine placement, and the adjacency rules.

## 1.1 The Board

Let $W, H \in \mathbb{N}^*$ denote the width and height of the board, respectively. We define the domain (or grid) $D$ as the finite set of lattice points:

$$
D = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{N}^2 \mid 1 \le x \le W, \quad 1 \le y \le H \}
$$

Each element $p \in D$ is referred to as a cell.

## 1.2 Mine Distribution

The placement of mines is determined by an indicator function $M$, which maps each position in the domain to a state indicating the presence or absence of a mine.

We define the function $M : D \to \{0, 1\}$ such that:

$$
M(p) = 
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if there is a mine at } p, \\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

This function represents the concealed game state.

The total number of mines $N_{total}$ satisfies:

$$N_{total} = \sum_{p \in D} M(p)$$


## 1.3 Neighborhood

Minesweeper operates on the Moore neighborhood, where each cell has up to 8 neighbors. For any position $p = (x, y) \in D$, we define its neighborhood $V(p)$ as the set of adjacent positions:

$$
V(p) = \{ (x', y') \in D \mid \max(|x - x'|, |y - y'|) = 1 \}
$$

Note that $p \notin V(p)$, meaning a cell is not a neighbor of itself.

## 1.4 Clues

For any position $p \in D$, the visible value (or clue) associated with the tile, denoted by $v(p)$, is defined as the sum of mines present in its neighborhood. 

Formally, the valuation function $v : D \to \mathbb{N}$ is given by:

$$
v(p) = \sum_{q \in V(p)} M(q)
$$

Since the maximum size of a neighborhood $|V(p)|$ is 8, it follows that $0 \le v(p) \le 8$.
