# 2. Player Knowledge

In Section 1, definitions have been established that allow us to describe the Minesweeper structure and board state from an omniscient standpoint. The player, however, has limited information about the board. In order to describe the information constraint, this section lists the information available to the player.

## 2.1 Revealed Tiles

The tiles explicitly revealed by the game are contained in the set $R$:

$$
R = \{ p \in D \mid \text{tile } p \text{ has been revealed to the player} \}
$$

The observation function $O : D \to \{0, 1, \dots, 8\} \cup \{u, m\}$ conveys the information acquired by the player's observation of any tile. Note that $u$ is the symbol for a  value of $v(p)$ that is unknown to the player and $m$ is the value in a tile that contains a mine

$$
O(p) = \begin{cases} 
    v(p) & \text{if } p \in R \land M(p) = 0\\
    m & \text{if } p \in R \land M(p) = 1\\
    u & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

## 2.2 Global Information

Besides the revealed tiles, the player is aware of the board dimensions ($D$) and the total number of mines in the board ($N_{total}$).
