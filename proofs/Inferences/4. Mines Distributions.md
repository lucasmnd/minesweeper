# 4. Mines Distributions

This section will define Mines Distributions: mathematical objects that will be useful to represent the distribution of mines and infer which tiles are safe/unsafe in a deterministic way.

## 4.1 Definition

A Mines Distribution $\mu$ is a tuple $(\mathcal{P}, N)$ where $\mathcal{P} \subseteq D\setminus R$ is a set of tiles that might contain the mines and $N \leq |\mathcal{P}| \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of mines contained in this distribution.

## 4.2 Semantics and Properties

A Mines Distribution represents a logical constraint on the game board. We establish the following properties regarding its relationship with the ground truth $M$:

* **Consistency**: A distribution $\mu = (\mathcal{P}, N)$ is consistent with the true mine placement $M$ if and only if:$$\sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} M(p) = N$$

* **Triviality**: Certain distributions provide immediate information about the state of contained tiles without requiring further operations:

  * <u>Clean Distribution</u>: If $N = 0$, then all tiles in $\mathcal{P}$ are safe ($M(p) = 0, \forall p \in \mathcal{P}$).

  * <u>Saturated Distribution</u>: If $N = |\mathcal{P}|$, then all tiles in $\mathcal{P}$ are mines ($M(p) = 1, \forall p \in \mathcal{P}$).

## 4.3 Relations and Operations

Individual Mines Distributions, derived directly from board clues, are often insufficient to determine the state of specific tiles. This leads us to define algebraic operations and relations to derive a new, often more restrictive, distribution.

Given two generic Mines Distributions $\mu _1 = (\mathcal{P}_1, N_1)$ and $\mu _2 = (\mathcal{P}_2, N_2)$, we define relations and operations between them.

### Relations

- Contained $(\subseteq)$:
$$\mu _1 \subseteq \mu _2 \iff \mathcal{P}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{P}_2$$

- Disjoint $(\parallel)$:
$$\mu _1 \parallel \mu _2 \iff \mathcal{P}_1 \cap \mathcal{P}_2 = \varnothing$$

### Operations

- Subtraction $(-)$:
$$\mu _1 - \mu _2 = (\mathcal{P}_1 \setminus \mathcal{P}_2, N_1 - N_2)$$

- Intersection $(\cap)$:
$$\mu _1 \cap \mu _2 = (\mathcal{P}_1 \cap \mathcal{P}_2, \min\{N_1, N_2\})$$
