# 5. Inference Rules

This section is a collection of rules that allow the player to infer new information from clues explicitly revealed by the game.

It is presumed that the game is not lost.

## 5.1 Fundamental Clue Rule

This is the basic rule that the player uses to transform the clues given by the game into mine distributions.

Let $p \in D$:

$$ v(p) = N \iff \mu = (V(p) \setminus R, N) \text{ is consistent} $$

**Proof (Direct):** The proof proceeds in two parts:
**1. $(\implies)$** Assume that $v(p) = N$. We must show that $\mu$ is consistent.

By definition: 

$$v(p) = N \iff \sum_{q \in V(p)} M(q) = N$$

Since it is presumed that the game is not lost:

$$\forall q \in R, M(q) = 0$$
